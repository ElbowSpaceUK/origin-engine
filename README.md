## About The Project

Origin is a customisable local development tool. It can help you manage everything from locally running your apps and working on their dependencies to managing your git workflow and ticketing system.
It works predominantly with PHP based applications, using `composer` for dependency management.

Implemented features
- Local site management. Spin up a new instance of any site with a single command.
- Local dependency tools. Quickly clone and symlink a dependency using php, making working on dependencies seamless.
- Create and publish code stubs to quickly scaffold repetitive structures
- Work on many branches in the same local site, and easily switch between features.

## Getting Started

For now, contact us for information on how to build your own. We will be writing our developer documentation shortly which will cover how to
use Origin for your own site.

We will also be releasing a project which will allow you to run your site with standard docker environments (such as Laravel Sail) in the near future.
